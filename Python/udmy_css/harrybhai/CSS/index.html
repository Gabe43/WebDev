<!-- There are three types by which we can inject css 
1. In Html using style tag
2. Creating a diff file named .css
3. Using style attribute within the div tag  
We acn use #idname to create div tag
Id needs to be unique, it cannot be replicated
 But we can assign as many as class name we want and it can also be replicated
# is used for targeting id and . is used for targeting class
We can use the text align function with the paragraph function to place the text as per our wish-->
